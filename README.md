This is a research project being conducted at the City College of New York, under the direction of Dr. David Rumschitzki, Professor of Chemical Engineering at the City College of New York.  Using time and distance data for U.S. dollar bills provided by the administrator of the website https://www.wheresgeorge.com/ we will analyze whether dollar bills in the data can be modelled accurately with diffusion models for particles in solution.
We have had success with the model when limiting the data to small times and distances, however we believe that airplane travel in data points with longer distances skews the data away from regular diffusion.  We intend to create a mathematical model that predicts the movement of dollar bills over time that incorporates both flight and non-flight travel.
